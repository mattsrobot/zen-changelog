September has been a busy month - the new Shopify app is officially ready for use.

We've changed the way zenshop is experienced for new users and our lovely current users, with this new "embedded" Shopify app.

- Now part of Shopify admin.
- You can change your plan, manage your team, configure your zenshop within Shopify.

We've also upgraded the Messenger, to integrate with Shopify CDN, delivering even faster speed to loading.

- Messenger will load faster than ever, making your shop just a little bit quicker.
- Messenger is also more configurable, allowing you to change the position and theme from within your Shops theme editor.

It's now easier to login to the Helpdesk apps, by using "Magic links".

- Simply enter your account email, and we'll send you a link to login.
- You can of also use your password just like before.

But ...

There's more to come - October and November some major upgrades will come to zenshop:

- Improved Spell Checking.
- Live Chat.
- Meta integrations.

Stay tuned!
