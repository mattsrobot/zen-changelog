In August and September, zenshop has some huge improvements to the Helpdesk planned!

We're kicking things off today with some little improvements to get the ball rolling.

The Helpdesk gets a facelift with:

- A cleaner icon!
- Better text focus handling
- A loading indicator

*Our new icon*

  <Image src="/images/helpdesk-improvements/icon-change.png" width={540} height={360} alt="Add saved search" />
</a>
*Text fields now focus nicely, with a clean font*

</a>
